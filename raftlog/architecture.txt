The raft log does not care what are the "commands" stored inside the log.
It cares only about "index", "term" and "type" of the entries. The "command" is an
opaque byte-slice, and it is responsibility of upper-level components to
give meaning to this byte-slice.

The raft log has a stack-like API: Append() appends to lasIndex + 1, and Remove() deletes
the entry at greatest index

Raft Rule Handler is the most-high-level component which works in
a rule-based fashion:

1) Executor component sends a message to handler component.
   Message may be:
    1. AppendEntries call from other raft node
    2. Command sent by client
    3. Timeout (of the node's own timer)
    4. etc.

2) Handler component acts based on the message and returns a list
   of actions it judges to be appropriate (i.e. conforming to raft
   protocol rules). In fact, the handler component implements
   iface.RuleHandler interface
  
3) Executor receives the list of actions and implements those
   actions.

Example:

1. Executor passes message "A candidate requested our vote";
2. Handler responds with "We should not grant our vote";
3. Executor uses the transport service to implement this action,
   effectively responding to the candidate
